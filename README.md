# Task Overview
A FastAPI microservice provides a `/register` endpoint to register users. After registration, the service is designed to send a welcome email asynchronously via a background task using FastAPI's BackgroundTasks. Recently, users are being registered successfully, but the welcome email logic is not executing, and expected email notifications (which are simulated by a console print statement) are not observed. The app is containerized for Docker deployment.

# Guidance
- Review the asynchronous registration and background task flow.
- Consider how BackgroundTasks are enqueued and executed in FastAPI routes.
- Focus on any details that might prevent the background function from running in the desired context.
- Ensure your solution considers the asynchronous nature of the endpoint and FastAPI's handling of background tasks.
- Validate the application's logging or console output as the test for email-sending behavior.

# Objectives
- Diagnose and repair the bug preventing the background email function from executing after user registration.
- Ensure the `/register` endpoint processes user data and reliably triggers the background welcome email logic after registration.
- Restore the expected behavior: a console output indicating that the "email" was sent whenever a user is registered.
- Maintain Dockerized deployment and application operability.

# How to Verify
- Register a new user using the `/register` endpoint.
- Confirm that the registration response is successful.
- Check the application console or container logs for an immediate message indicating the welcome email logic has run after each registration.
